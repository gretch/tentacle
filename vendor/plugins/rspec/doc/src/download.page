There are several ways to download RSpec. Which way is right for you depends on how you want to use it.

h3. Rubygems

This is the preferred way for non-Rails projects. Non-windows users may have to use sudo. Download the latest with:

<pre>
gem install rspec
</pre>  

or if you want an older version:

<pre>
gem install rspec -v 1.0.8
</pre>  

h3. Ruby on Rails projects

See "Rails":documentation/rails/install.html

h3. Direct download

Get it from "Rubyforge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=797

h3. Subversion

Check it out:

<pre>
svn checkout http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk rspec_trunk
</pre>

or

<pre>
svn checkout http://rspec.rubyforge.org/svn/tags/{<%= svn_tag %>: }/rspec rspec_{<%= svn_tag %>: }
</pre>

See the "README":rdoc/files/README.html for details about how to build it.
