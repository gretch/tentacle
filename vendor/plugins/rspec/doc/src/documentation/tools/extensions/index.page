RSpec extensions typically come in two different kinds: API extensions and runner extensions.

h3. API Extensions

API extensions are extensions to RSpec's core expectation API.

h3. Runner Extensions

Runner extensions can consist of plugins to other tools (such as editors and IDEs) as well as custom RSpec formatters.
