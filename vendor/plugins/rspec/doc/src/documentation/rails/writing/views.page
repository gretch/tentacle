View Examples live in $RAILS_ROOT/spec/views/.

Spec::Rails supports the specification of views in complete isolation from their controllers.
This allows you to spec and write your views even before their controllers exist,
or before the related actions have been developed. It also means that bugs introduced
into controllers will not cause view specs to fail.

As noted in the "introduction":index.html, these are great benefits
but they could hide bugs that exist in the interaction between a controller and its
view. We strongly recommend combining these isolated view specs with some sort of
high level integration testing, ideally using "RSpec stories":stories.html

Here are some of the methods available to you, but see "Spec::Rails::Expectations":../../../rdoc-rails/index.html for more detail.

h2. Conveniences

h3. assigns

Use assigns[:key] to set instance variables to be used in the view. We highly recommend that
you exploit the mock framework here rather than providing real model objects in order to
keep the view specs isolated from changes to your models.

<coderay>
# example
article = mock_model(Article)
article.should_receive(:author).and_return("Joe")
article.should_receive(:text).and_return("this is the text of the article")
assigns[:article] = article
assigns[:articles] = [article]

# template
<%% for article in @articles -%>
<!-- etc -->
</coderay>

h3. flash, params and session

Use flash[:key], params[:key] and session[:key] to set values in the example that can
be accessed by the view.

<coderay>
# example
flash[:notice] = "Message in flash"
params[:account_id] = "1234"
session[:user_id] = "5678"

# template
<%%= flash[:notice] %>
<%%= params[:account_id] %>
<%%= session[:user_id] %>
</coderay>

h2. Expectations

Spec::Rails' View Examples support the following custom expectations.

h3. template.expect_render/stub_render

This is a custom mock-like expectation that allows you to set expectations about partials and included
files that will be rendered, intercepting those calls to the #render method, while ignoring other calls
and passing them on to ActionView::Base. <code>expect_render</code> is verified at the end of the
example, while <code>stub_render</code> is not.

%{color:red;font-weight:bold}WARNING%: expect_render and stub_render, while very useful, act
differently from standard Message Expectations (a.k.a. mock expectations), which would never pass calls
through to the real object. This can be very confusing when there are failures if you're not aware of this
fact, because some calls will be passed through while others will not. This is especially confusing when
you use <code>stub_render</code> because, as with all Method Stubs, you will get very little feedback
about what is going on.

<coderay>
template.expect_render(:partial => 'person', :object => @person) #auto-verified
template.stub_render(:partial => 'person', :object => @person)   #not verified
</coderay>


h3. response.should have_tag

This wraps assert_select and is available in both View Examples and Controller Examples run in integration mode.

<coderay>
response.should have_tag('div') #passes if any div tags appear
response.should have_tag('div#interesting_div')
response.should have_tag('div', 'expected content')
response.should have_tag('div', /regexp matching expected content/)
response.should have_tag('form[action=?]', things_path)
response.should have_tag("input[type=?][checked=?]", 'checkbox', 'checked')
response.should have_tag('ul') do
  with_tag('li', 'list item 1')
  with_tag('li', 'list item 2')
  with_tag('li', 'list item 3')
end
</coderay>

Note that any of the hash values can be either Strings or Regexps and will be
evaluated accordingly.

h3. response[:capture].should have_tag

This way you can access content that has been captured with <tt>content_for</tt>.

<ruby>
# example
response[:sidebar].should have_tag('div')

# template
&lt;% content_for :sidebar do %>
  <div><p>Sidebar content here</p></div>
&lt;% end %>
</ruby>

h2. Mocking and stubbing helpers

If you wish to mock or stub helper methods, this must be done on the <tt>template</tt> object:

<coderay>
template.should_receive(:current_user).and_return(mock("user"))
</coderay>

%{color:red;font-weight:bold}WARNING:% Do NOT use mocks on the template object for expecting partials.
Instead, use expect_render or stub_render, described above.
