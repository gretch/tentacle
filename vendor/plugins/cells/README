= Overview

Cells is a rails plugin for a new concept of code organization. Instead of
pushing everything into the ApplicationControllers, logic and views are
encapsulated in flexible cells.

Cells can be described best as "lightweight controllers" - they are classes
that implement the business logic in methods and can render views.
Cells can be called in controllers or within views and plug themselfs into
any part of the page.


= Documentation

The documentation is currently being worked upon.  You will find basic
reference documentation in here.  You can probably best start looking
at the documentation of the Cell::Base class.

See http://cells.rubyforge.org for documentation targeted at cells
newbies, including an overview of what you can do with cells and a
tutorial.
